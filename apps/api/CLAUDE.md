# The station: chassis

How `apps/api` is wired underneath any one subsystem — module lifecycle, configuration, settings,
plugin selection, the database connections and the import aliases. What each MODULE does is in the
files under [`docs/internals/`](../../docs/internals); this is the ground they all stand on.

Every paragraph here records a measured failure and the fix that was chosen over the obvious one.
Read the ones covering whatever you are about to change. The always-loaded index is
[`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).

## A setting is a string, and that is the whole of it

**Every layer of `AppConfig` holds STRINGS, so an on/off setting is read through `settingIsOn` and never as a
boolean.** `AppConfigSourcePostgres.load()` snapshots each `deadair.settings` row as the raw text of its
`value` column and parses nothing (its `tryParseJson` serves only the single-key `get()` behind a `${pg:…}`
reference, which is not the path a module read takes); dotenv is the same. So `config.get(key, false)` answers
the STRING `'false'`, which is truthy — every switch written that way could be turned on and never back off,
in silence, with the console showing the change and the table holding it. That was live in six places,
including `rotation.discover` and all three `llm.*` model switches, and in `OTP_DEV_BYPASS`, where `false` in
a `.env` ENABLED the bypass and only the positive `NODE_ENV` allowlist beside it kept that from mattering.
`modules/shared/setting.flags.ts` owns the vocabulary now (`true/1/yes/on`, `false/0/no/off`, anything else
and the empty string take the declared default rather than `false`, because a value nobody can parse is a
setting nobody set). Numbers have the same problem and the same shape of answer: `resolveAnalysisConcurrency`,
`resolveRetentionDays`, `maxOutputTokens`. **The two connection ports are the version of this that hid
longest**: `DATABASE_PORT` and `REDIS_PORT` were read as `config.get(key, 5432)`, which types as
`number` and answers the string, and both drivers coerce it, so the only visible symptom was the one
nobody saw: a typo became `NaN`, which `pg` reads as a port nobody set and answers with its own 5432.
Both go through `requiredNumber` now, in `database.connection.ts` and `redis.connection.ts`.

**A test that hands over a real boolean proves nothing here** — it passes either way — so a switch's off-case
is tested with the string, and a config double that coerces on the way out is worse than no double at all:
`model.set.generator.test.ts` had one for as long as it existed and hid this bug the whole time.

**`deadair.settings` is a layer of `AppConfig`, so reading a setting needs no scope.** `setup.server.ts`
builds a boot snapshot (dotenv only, for the log store and the database credentials), then an
`AppConfigStore` over that same dotenv layer plus `AppConfigSourcePostgres` pointed at
`deadair.settings`, and hands the container `store.toLiveConfig()` — a live view whose every read
resolves against the current snapshot. So `config.get('playout.airMode')` works from a singleton
with no DI scope, which is what `AudienceWatch` and the playout transport are. Keys stay flat and
dotted; nothing collides with dotenv's SCREAMING_SNAKE. `scrubProcessEnv()` runs after both builds,
which is why the settings source is handed **resolved literal** credentials rather than `${env:…}`
templates: it would otherwise connect once and fail every reload after that, silently, because a
failed rebuild keeps the last-good config.

The store holds a `LISTEN` on `deadair_settings_changed` (migration 0003's trigger), so a row edited
by psql applies live. **A write made inside a request cannot be read back through the config in that
same request** — Postgres holds notifications until COMMIT — so `SettingsService.set`/`write` defer
`store.reload()` through `AfterCommit`, and a route that must answer with what it wrote builds that
answer from the write rather than re-reading. Writing a setting anywhere else has to do the same or
the operator's change will not take.

**Settings are declared in `settings.registry.ts`** as the plugin SDK's `ConfigField`, which is what lets one
console component render both a plugin's settings and the station's. `GET`/`PUT /settings` are the operator
surface; a `secret` is reported as a configured-boolean and never as a value. The registry is not where a
setting is READ — each module keeps its typed resolver (`resolveStreamSettings`, `parseAirMode`,
`stationRules`) and shares the registry's defaults so the two cannot disagree. A row nobody declared is left
alone rather than deleted.

**A `number` shares its RANGE for the same reason it shares its default, and the two sides of that range
answer differently on purpose**: the resolver CLAMPS, because it is reading a row that is already stored and a
setting that refuses to load stops the walk behind it, while `serializeSetting` REFUSES, because that is
somebody typing one and a clamp there stores a figure they did not ask for and shows it back as though they
had. The console clamps too, where the number visibly changes in front of them. Undeclared bounds were how
`analysis.concurrency` accepted 400 and ran at 32. Two of the four mixer knobs are settings now,
`stream.duckGainDb` and `stream.duckFadeMs`, because the Liquidsoap restart they waited for exists: the config
watch restarts the audio chain whenever a save changes `radio.env`. Talk-over and the voice trim are still
constants in `stream.service.ts` ([mixer-settings-in-db](https://github.com/robert-dean/deadair/discussions/20)).

**Some lengths are RANGES, and the resolvers behind them are the only ones here allowed to be random.**
`render.productionMinutesMin`/`Max`, `render.dialogueMinutesMin`/`Max` and `rotation.newsStoriesMin`/`Max`,
because a programme that is always exactly the same length is the one thing about a schedule a listener
notices without being able to say why. What makes a non-deterministic resolver safe here and nowhere else is
that the answer is read ONCE and stored — `stationTargetMs` is called at commission and goes straight into
`productions.target_ms`, and every pass afterwards reads the row — so there is nothing for a second roll to
contradict; `random` is a parameter for the reason `storiesFor`'s `now` is one. Both ends are read as an
unordered PAIR and clamped, on the resolver rule above.

**Which lengths are worth ranging is measured rather than assumed**: a BREAK is given a ceiling rather than a
budget and the model stops where it stops, so talk breaks already span 3 to 100 words around a median of 28
and randomising `rotation.breakWords` would be a no-op — only a production's `target_ms` and a bulletin's
story COUNT are the mechanical kind, which is why those two got it and the word ceilings did not.

## Reading and writing the database

**A SQL NULL reads back as `undefined` while the generated types say `null`, so every optional column
is compared with `== null`.** The driver hands back `undefined` for a null column and
`src/modules/data/db.ts` types it `T | null`, so `row.x === null` is a test that is always false and
`row.x !== null` is a guard that always passes — which is how an undated record arrives at
`Number(undefined)` as `NaN` rather than being dropped. Around a dozen repositories carry a comment
pointing at this rule, and until the file was split it pointed at a paragraph that had never been
written: it lived only in one person's notes, which is the failure mode of a rule everybody knows and
nobody wrote down. The convention on top of it is that a repository's row mapper DROPS an absent
optional rather than passing it through, so the shape reaching the rest of the app is the codebase's
own `undefined`-means-not-set and never a third state.

**Two database pools, and the isolation they are FOR is not built.** The runtime pool connects as the non-owner `app_user` role (created `nobypassrls`, granted DML only) and a separate owner pool handles privileged maintenance, so the runtime path cannot alter the schema. That is all it currently buys: **no migration declares a single RLS policy**, there is no organization table to isolate by, and the four `app.actor_*` GUCs set on every request transaction and every `TransactionalJob` are read by nothing — no trigger, no policy, no `current_setting` anywhere. Nine places used to state or imply otherwise, including this one. [row-level-security](https://github.com/robert-dean/deadair/discussions/31) records what would have to be built and, more importantly, the one thing that must not happen: **the per-request transaction must not be deleted on the grounds that its RLS justification was fiction.** Its other two reasons are live — `AfterCommit` running when the work is durable, and a job enqueued during a request committing atomically with it — which is why the exempt branch runs `AfterCommit` itself.

**Sessions outlive the database.** Sessions and refresh-token families live in Redis, actors live in
Postgres, so a schema rebuild wipes one store and not the other and leaves browsers holding tokens
that verify against a user who no longer exists. The root `rebuild:data` and `db:reset` scripts
therefore end in `pnpm flush:sessions` (`redis-cli FLUSHALL`); a reset that skips it hands the
operator a session with no actor. The API rejects that state rather than trusting it, in
`authorization.context.middleware` for authenticated requests and in
`AuthenticationService.refuseIfSubjectIsGone` for the refresh grant, both of which revoke the
session and answer 401 instead of letting it through as a user who holds no permissions. The
refresh check runs as `refreshSession`'s guard, after the token is verified and its `jti` claimed,
because `lookupSessionFromJwt` refuses a refresh token since @maroonedsoftware/authentication 6: a
peek through it fails on every call, and a peek whose failure is swallowed checks nothing.

**One Redis client, and `resolveRedisConnection` decides what it connects as.** Both rate limiters,
`SignInMailLimiter`, `IoRedisCacheProvider` and the session store all resolve the single `Redis`
singleton `DataModule` registers, so there is exactly one place to configure and no second client to
forget. Until [#160](https://github.com/robert-dean/deadair/issues/160) that place read `REDIS_HOST`
and `REDIS_PORT` and nothing else, so a Redis wanting `AUTH` could not be pointed at and the reporter
ran a second daemon instead. `redis.connection.ts` now reads `REDIS_USERNAME`, `REDIS_PASSWORD` and
`REDIS_TLS` beside them, and accepts `REDIS_URL` as an alternative that **wins whole**: when it is
set, none of the five discrete variables is consulted, because a merge produces a station connecting
to the right host as the wrong user, and the `full` image fills the loopback defaults in itself (its
`database-env` now skips them when a URL is set, which is what makes that rule load-bearing rather
than tidy). A URL that cannot be parsed stops the boot, on `requiredNumber`'s rule, and no error
message here ever quotes the value, because a Redis URL carries the password.

## Module lifecycle

**Module lifecycle order is load-bearing, and SHUTDOWN runs in REVERSE registration order.** The list in
`apps/api/src/modules/modules.ts` is ordered deliberately and the comments there explain each placement.
`PluginsModule` sits after everything its host reaches into, and `PlaylistsModule` after `PluginsModule`. Work
the first request does not depend on belongs in `ready()`, after the socket is up, not in `start()`. ServerKit
walks ONE list both ways, forwards to build and backwards to tear down, so a module releases what it holds
while everything it depends on is still alive — which is what you want almost everywhere and means the
position is simply a dependency order.

**The counter-intuitive half is at the TOP of the list: a module that must close LAST registers FIRST.**
`LoggingModule` is first so the log store closes after every other module's shutdown logging has flushed
through `DeadairLogger`, and `DataConnectionsModule` is second so the pools outlive every module that writes
during its own teardown — `DataModule` has to register early because everything resolves what it registers,
and closing in its own position is what once left every module tearing down against a destroyed driver, losing
the director's flush of the running order, which is a guarantee rather than a nicety, on nine of the shutdowns
in one log. Both are shutdown-only modules, so sitting ahead of `HealthModule` costs boot nothing.
`JobsModule` sits after `PluginsModule` for the same reason read the other way: registering later is what
stops the workers before the plugin instances under them are disposed.

And **no hook may cost the others their teardown, or the process its exit**: the reversal did not touch this,
the shutdown loop still catches nothing and bounds nothing, unlike the `ready` loop above it, so
`withBoundedShutdown` wraps every hook at the list. A hook that hung left fourteen processes in that log still
running their loops after being told to stop, one of them probing Liquidsoap for hours on a rotated secret.
`apps/api/tests/modules/modules.test.ts` holds the whole ordering, and reads every assertion through a
`tearsDownBefore` helper rather than through raw positions.

**A `ready` hook that throws is logged and boot carries on, so a hook the station cannot run without has
to stop the process itself.** ServerKit's ready loop is fault-isolated, which is right for a cache warm
and was wrong for `JobsModule`: the runner is what consumes every row the director enqueues and what
fires every cron, and with its `start()` failed the process printed "Boot complete", served every route
and answered `/health` 200 while the running order ran out with nothing to fill it. That module now
catches the failure, sets `process.exitCode = 1` and sends itself `SIGTERM`: the same graceful close a
supervisor's stop takes, so every module still tears down in order and the log store flushes the line
that says why. Nothing else in the list has earned that; a new hook that does should copy the shape
rather than call `process.exit`, which skips both. `setup.server.ts` installs the same shape on
`unhandledRejection` and `uncaughtException` right after the logger exists
(`server/crash.handlers.ts`), so a rejection that used to take the process down silently now names
itself first.

**Logging is process-level and predates DI.** `RotatingLogStore` is constructed in
`setup.server.ts` before any container exists, published through `setLogStore`, and wrapped by
`DeadairLogger` so every module's lines land on stdout and in `logs/`. `PluginLog` tees plugin
output to the app logger plus a per-plugin rotating file with its own verbosity gate. Malformed
`LOG_MAX_*` values fail loudly at boot by design, through `requiredNumber` in
`modules/shared/setting.numbers.ts` — the numeric sibling of `settingIsOn` and there for the same
reason, since **every layer of `AppConfig` holds strings and `get`'s overload widens its return from
the DEFAULT**, so a set value arrives as text while TypeScript reports a number. This claim was in
the tree for a long time before anything implemented it, and what an unvalidated `LOG_MAX_BYTES=2MB`
actually produced was a store that threw on every append into a wrapper that cannot report one: a
healthy-looking server with an empty logs directory. `LoggingModule` owns only the store's shutdown
and reaches it through `getLogStore()` rather than the container, because the DI token is registered
by `PluginsModule`, which tears down long before it.

**`/logs` is the read side of that store, and `LogsService` reaches it through `getLogStore()` for the
same reason `LoggingModule` does.** For a long time `/plugins/{id}/logs` was the only log route there
was, so the one file carrying every subsystem could be read only by somebody with a shell on the box
— which the single-container deployment exists partly to make unnecessary. Three sources, a closed
table in `modules/station/logs.sources.ts`: the app channel, and the audio chain's and the shim's own
files, which `stream/radio.liq` says were put on disk so all three could be read on one timeline.
Their directory is `STREAM_LOGS_DIR`, or the sibling `streamlogs` of `LOGS_DIR` when nothing set one,
which is already right for the production image and deliberately absent in the dev tree, where the
API cannot see those files at all. **Neither of those two is rotated by anything**, so both the tail
and the download read a bounded number of bytes off the END of the file through
`logging/file.tail.ts` rather than reading the file — a `readFile` there is a read of however much
disk the operator's uptime has earned. The route is `platform.manage` rather than `platform.view`,
on `traces.ck`'s argument plus a concrete case: at `LOG_LEVEL=4` the harbor logs every header of
every control call, so the bridge secret can be in `liquidsoap.log` in plain text.

## How work is dispatched

**Four mechanisms, and which one a piece of work takes is decided by its properties rather than by taste.**

A **director command** on `DirectorMailbox` for anything that changes what airs. One at a time and in order, because the whole of `docs/internals/director.md`'s ownership rule is that there is one writer of the running order; a second path into it is the bug that file enumerates four times.

A **pg-boss job** (`jobs.send`) for work that is slow, outbound, wants retries, and that nobody is waiting on. The worked example is `onAired`: the rundown's own event records what a listener actually heard and hands everything downstream of that — the scrobble, the history write's followers — to jobs, deliberately NOT to a director command, because none of it changes what is on air and a slow destination must not sit in front of the thing that does.

**`AfterCommit`** for work that must see its own row durable and would read it too early inline. A settings reload (Postgres holds `NOTIFY` until COMMIT), a plugin reinit (`PluginLifecycleManager` reads that row on its own pooled connection and would otherwise wait on the lock the request is holding), a `recast`. The rule of thumb: if the work re-reads what the request just wrote, it is this one.

A **plain call** for anything synchronous the caller is actually waiting on. Most code.

**There is no general event bus, and the absence is deliberate.** `@maroonedsoftware/eventbus` is a dependency this app declares and never imports. A synchronous fail-fast bus on the aired edge makes one slow or broken subscriber — a push destination, a scrobble — cost the station the top-up that should have followed, unless every subscriber is defensively wrapped, which is a discipline rather than a structure. The four above already say where each of those belongs.

**The one exception is `StationBus` (`modules/shared/station.bus.ts`), and what earns it is the DIRECTION of a dependency rather than a preference for events.** It is for the case where a producer and the thing that should react to it sit on opposite sides of the list in `modules.ts` and neither may import the other: an audience arriving in `playout` and the greeting that answers it in `director`; a plugin's settings saved in `plugins` and the enrichment rows that go stale in `enrichment`; an operator disliking something in `catalog` and the running order that has to lose it in `director`. It is narrow on purpose — a closed event map with one line per arm, added only when something subscribes — and it answers the objection above rather than ignoring it: `publish` never throws, every subscriber's throw is caught and logged, and nothing published is something the publisher waits on. The transport's own seams (`Rundown.onChange`, `onAired`, `onReset`) stay where they are, because those are hot ordered couplings and a bus flattens ordering. A publisher whose subscriber must read what the request just wrote publishes from `AfterCommit`, which is the rule above and not a separate one. This paragraph exists because the flat sentence before it sent more than one reader looking for a mechanism that was already in the tree.

And **admission control is not a dispatch mechanism**: whether a production is admitted as a PASS or a BEAT is a decision about content, it is argued in [produced-episodes](https://github.com/robert-dean/deadair/discussions/27), and building it as a fifth channel here is the shape to refuse.

## Plugins, from the host side

**A capability with several plugins and no setting picks the FIRST, and says so.** `selectPlugin`
(`modules/plugins/plugin.selection.ts`) is one rule shared by `render.speechPluginId`, `llm.pluginId` and
`analysis.pluginId`, because a capability that answers differently depending on which subsystem is asking is
the failure that file exists to prevent. It used to answer nothing here, arguing that a pick the operator did
not make looks deliberate — which weighs a wrong-looking choice against SILENCE, and for speech silence is
what it cost: installing a second TTS plugin took the station off the air until somebody visited a settings
page, while everywhere else the station has this choice it degrades instead (the writer registry falls
through, the set chain tops up, the floor cannot fail). The objection is answered by SAYING SO —
`explainDefaultPick` names what was chosen and what it was chosen over, written once on the edge
(`defaultPickIsNews`, module state because all three services are SCOPED and `speaker()` runs on every commit
pass). Three things stay true.

**A setting naming a plugin that is not a candidate still answers nothing without falling back**, because that
is an instruction where the other is a default, and quietly using a different engine is how a station ends up
wrong with nothing in the log.

**"First" means `byPluginId` order**, so every caller sorts — `AnalysisService.candidates` was the one that
did not, which "first" made load-bearing rather than tidy. And `explainNoPlugin` now has two branches rather
than three, since several-and-none-chosen is no longer a refusal.

**Which capability pairs with which setting is a TABLE, not a paragraph repeated at each call site.**
`modules/plugins/plugin.providers.ts` holds one row per capability an operator chooses between —
`{ capability, mode, settingKey, as, fallback? }` — and the services reach their candidates through
`pluginsInOrder`/`pluginInUse` over that row rather than composing `pluginsWith`, a sort and a key read
themselves. The rules were already shared; the PAIRING was not, and that is what a second reader needed.
The second reader is the console: `GET /plugins/providers` reports who can answer a capability, who is
answering it and in what position, computed from the same table and the same helpers, because a settings
page that works the choice out for itself is a settings page that can confidently name a plugin the station
does not reach. `declared.options.ts` had already started down that road with its own copy of
`selectPlugin`'s "an empty setting means the first by id".

**Ordering a fan-out is `plugin.order.ts`, and it orders without ever gating.** `byOrderThen(order,
fallback)` puts what the operator listed first and leaves everything else to the capability's own
fallback — `byPluginId` for all but enrichment, whose fallback is the plugin author's declared
`priority`. So an unset setting reproduces exactly what the capability did before it had one, which is
what makes the order safe to add to a capability; and a listed id that nothing answers to is absent
rather than fatal, because a setting that could silently switch off the only plugin answering a
capability turns a typo into a station with no similarity, no weather and no facts. Six keys use it:
`rotation.similarityOrder`, `weather.providerOrder`, `charts.providerOrder`,
`enrichment.providerOrder`, and the four pick-one keys read through the same table. Capabilities that
fan out and MERGE without ranking — search, scrobble, podcast, narration, catalog — are deliberately
not in the table: order changes nothing about a union, and a knob whose every position is the same is
worse than no knob.

**Nothing watches `plugin_configs`.** A plugin's configuration changes only through
`PluginsService`, and every route there that writes one reinitializes the plugin itself. There is no
`LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` path and no trigger on the table (an earlier one was removed): a row edited out of
band is applied by `POST /plugins/:id/reload`, or not at all. Anything that grows a second writer of
that table has to call `PluginLifecycleManager.reinitPlugin` itself, and has to do it through
`AfterCommit` rather than inline: the manager is a singleton reading and writing that row on its own
pooled connection, so from inside the request's transaction it reads the row as it stood BEFORE the
write and its own `setStatus` upsert then waits on the lock the request is holding, while the
request waits on it. Postgres does not call that a deadlock, because only one of the two is waiting
in the database. `reloadPlugin` is inline precisely because it writes nothing.

**The plugins directory carries the host's SDK and zod as symlinks, and the host writes them.** A plugin
declares both as PEERS so it shares the host's single copy, and for a bundled plugin `docker/link-peers.mjs`
satisfies that by linking them into `/app/node_modules`, which Node's walk up from `/app/plugins/<name>` reaches.
An installed plugin lives under `/data/plugins`, and that walk never reaches `/app`: its first
`import '@deadair/plugin-sdk'` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` and it was quarantined for a package it
correctly declared it does not own. So `PluginPeerLinker` (`modules/plugins/plugin.peers.ts`) links
`<PLUGINS_DIR>/node_modules/{@deadair/plugin-sdk,zod}` at the host's own resolved copies before every discovery
and every rescan, derived from the SDK's non-optional `peerDependencies` exactly as `link-peers.mjs` is, so a peer
added later is covered without anybody remembering this. Node keys the module cache on the real path, so the
plugin is handed the host's very instance, and `plugin.peers.test.ts` proves it by spawning a real `node`,
because vitest resolves a bare specifier from the project root wherever it appears and so passes either way.
Two ways to break it quietly: tidying it into a one-off at boot (an image upgrade moves the store path the link
points at, and Rescan is what puts that right), and making `PLUGINS_DIR` a read-only mount, whose symptom is a
warning at boot and every installed plugin quarantined with an import error. A missing directory is not created,
and a real directory where a link belongs is left alone.

**An import is staged under `<PLUGINS_DIR>/.staging` and judged by the station's own loader before it is moved
into place** (`modules/plugins/plugin.installer.ts`). Inside the plugins directory rather than the system temp
directory, because the move is then a `rename` and because Node's walk up from there reaches the peer links, so
the staged copy resolves the SDK exactly as it will installed; and the loader skips every dot-prefixed entry, so
a rescan landing mid-import sees nothing half-written. The installer is the one caller allowed to create
`PLUGINS_DIR` and link the peers itself, since an operator has just asked for something to be put there. Four
things in it look tidier undone and are not. The folder is named `<name>-<version>` because Node caches a module
by URL for the life of the process: new code at a NEW path is read on the next discovery, new code at the SAME
path is not, and `hasImportedPluginEntry` in the loader is what turns the second case into `restartRequired`
rather than a plugin silently running its old build. On an upgrade `PluginInstallService` disposes the old
instance BEFORE `rescan`, because rescan disposes only ids that vanished and an id that moved folder is upserted
over its live instance, which is then unreachable. The inflated stream is counted by hand while the headers are
read, before extraction, because tar's own guard is a ratio and a ratio bounds nothing absolutely. And `remove`
checks that the folder's PARENT is the plugins directory and unlinks a symlink rather than following it: the
folder's own real path is exactly what a linked-in dev checkout gets wrong, and following the link would delete
somebody's work. None of this makes a plugin safer to run. Staging IMPORTS the entry, as a rescan does, because a
manifest holds a live zod schema; what the checks answer is a tarball that would write outside its folder, fill
the disk or shadow the SDK.

## Conventions

**Import aliases** are `#src/*`, `#routes/*`, `#modules/*`, and they are declared THREE times
because three different things resolve them, none of which can read the others. `paths` in
`apps/api/tsconfig.json` type-checks them and nothing more: `tsc` never rewrites an emitted
specifier, so `dist/` still asks for `#src/...`. `apps/api/package.json#imports` is what answers
that at RUNTIME, and it is conditional — `dist/` by default, which is the whole reason `node
dist/index.js` works in a production image, and `src/` under the `development` condition, which
`scripts/dev.watch.mjs` asks for with `--conditions=development` so a stale `dist/` can never be
preferred over the file just saved. `vitest.config.ts` spells the same mapping out a third time,
since its esbuild transform reads neither. Measured: the dev loader's own resolver satisfies these
through tsconfig before the imports field is consulted, so the condition flag is a belt-and-braces
guarantee rather than the mechanism. `#shared/*` is gone — it pointed at a `src/shared` that never
existed; shared code lives in `src/modules/shared`. Local imports carry `.js` extensions.

**Neither `tests/` nor `scripts/` is built, and both are type-checked.** `pnpm --filter @deadair/api typecheck` is `typecheck:tests` (`tsconfig.tests.json`) then `typecheck:scripts` (`scripts/tsconfig.json`), and both widen `rootDir` to the workspace root — `rootDir` is a rule about where EMIT inputs may live and there is none, while pinning it rejects a boundary fixture from `packages/plugin-sdk/tests` and `verify.speech.ts` importing the kokoro plugin, both of which are deliberate. Neither folder is in the build tsconfig, so `tsc` still compiles only shippable code. This is not decoration: vitest transpiles without checking types and the scripts had no runner at all, so both folders had silently stopped compiling against the code they cover — four of five smoke scripts at once. **CI runs it now**, as `pnpm typecheck` (the root `turbo run typecheck`) in the build job, which it did not until a persona fixture in `apps/web` spent a while setting a field the contract had renamed: a script that has to be remembered is a check that is not one. It covers the four packages that DECLARE the script — this one, `apps/web`, `apps/site`, `apps/streamdeck` — and the plugins' own `tests/` are still unchecked, five of the thirteen not currently compiling; the comment on the step says what covering them would take.
