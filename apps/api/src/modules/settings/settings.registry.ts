/**
 * What a station setting is, declared once.
 *
 * Everything an operator can change about a station that is not a plugin's own
 * business lives here: its key, what to call it, what kind of input it is, and
 * what it means when nobody has set it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a plugin's `ConfigField`
 *
 * Because a plugin's settings form and a station's settings form are the same
 * problem, and the console already renders one. `ConfigField` is not a plugin
 * concept that has been borrowed — it is a declarative description of a row in a
 * settings form, it is already JSON-safe by the boundary test, it already knows
 * about `secret` (write-only, never read back) and `select` and `dependsOn`, and
 * the alternative is a second vocabulary that starts identical and drifts.
 *
 * ## What the registry deliberately is not
 *
 * It is not where a setting is READ. Reading one is `AppConfig.get`, wherever
 * you are, because `deadair.settings` is a config layer. Each module keeps its
 * own typed resolver over that (`resolveStreamSettings`, `parseAirMode`), and
 * those resolvers are what the app runs on. This describes the same keys for the
 * benefit of a human at a console, and shares their defaults so the two cannot
 * disagree.
 *
 * It is also not a complete list of what is in the table. A row nobody declared
 * here is left exactly alone: read by whatever reads it, ignored by the console,
 * and never deleted. That matters because settings arrive before their console
 * does.
 */
export interface SettingDescriptor extends ConfigField {
    /**
     * Which part of the console owns this setting.
     *
     * A section of the settings page for all but three of them. `schedule`, `personas` and
     * `phrasings` are the exceptions and are deliberately not drawn there: what the station plays
     * between blocks is a question about the timetable, what an unnamed host is called is a question
     * about the roster, and the words the station says are a question about its voice, so each is
     * edited beside the thing it explains. See the groups' own note below.

/**
 * The groups there are, in the order the settings page draws the ones it draws.
 *
 * Not every group is a card on that page. `schedule` is owned by `SustainingPanel` on the schedule
 * page, `personas` by `PresenterNamePanel` on the characters page and `phrasings` by the Voice
 * page's Phrasings tab, which is why
 * `SETTINGS_SECTIONS` in `settings.shell.tsx` is a list of its own rather than this one: a
 * group that is not in that list is drawn by whoever claimed it, and a group in neither is a bug
 * `settings.registry.test.ts` cannot see. Adding one means deciding which page draws it.
 *
 * `station`, `stream` and `housekeeping` were one group until it grew to thirty-one fields under a
 * single save: ten identity fields, fifteen stream formats and HLS settings, two pieces of
 * housekeeping and four passwords, each of them a different reason to open the page. Split along
 * `SettingGroup` in `settings.types.ck`, so the wire enum and this list cannot disagree about what
 * a group is called. The passwords were a fourth group, `secrets`, until none of them was declared
 * any more; the note above `mail` below says why.
 *
 * `rotation` went the same way at forty-two fields and six boxes of phrasings: what the station
 * plays stayed, how often it talks went to `breaks`, what a bulletin reads went to `bulletins`, and
 * the words it says around them went to `phrasings`, off the settings page altogether.
