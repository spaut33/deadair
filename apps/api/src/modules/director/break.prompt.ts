/**
 * What the station asks a model for, and what it will accept back.
 *
 * Two pure functions and no I/O, so the interesting decisions here — which are all about what the
 * model must NOT do — are testable without a model. The binding that uses them is
 * `model.talk.break.writer.ts`.
 *
 * ## The one failure this is shaped around
 *
 * [station-intelligence](https://github.com/robert-dean/deadair/discussions/37) §9: a prompt asked to be concrete about music and shown no
 * track fields reaches into training data and describes a record that is not playing. The failure
 * is specific — it is not that a model invents facts, it is that it frames real facts as a CUE
 * ("coming up", "you just heard", "that was"). So the FRAMING is banned rather than the noun, since
 * a break about a record that may not name the record is not a break. And certainty is asked for
 * separately, because inventing a credit and mis-cueing a real record are independent failures and
 * one instruction covering both gets neither.
 *
 * That ban was an instruction and nothing read it back, which is the half {@link misCuedIn} now
 * closes: a break may cue a record it was genuinely shown and still put it on the wrong side of
 * itself, and a mis-cue is baked into audio that cannot be re-cut. It is the same enforcement
 * `segments.claims_item_id` is for a forward promise, pointed at the words instead of the order.
 *
 * ## The notes, and the second failure they bring
 *
 * A record now arrives with up to two short true sentences about it, chosen by the caller (see
 * `BreakTrack.facts`). They make the §9 rules above MORE necessary rather than less: a model handed
 * one real fact will happily hang a cue off it. They also bring a failure of their own, which is a
 * model reading a note out as it stands — "Active as a recording artist from 1948 to 2025" is a
 * real row here, and it is a database entry rather than something a person says. So the notes are
 * offered as raw material for one line, in the station's own voice, droppable.
 *
 * That instruction is in the USER turn rather than the system one, because the failure does not
 * exist for a station that has enriched nothing: with no notes there is nothing to read aloud
 * badly, and a rule about them would be a rule about nothing.

/**
 * What makes one KIND of break's prompt different from another's.
 *
 * The seam that keeps this file from growing a branch per kind. `BreakWriter` is already a registry
 * over kinds rather than one writer with parameters, on the argument that a fifth kind of break is a
 * fifth writer; a `greeting?: boolean` here would have been that same mistake made a second time,
 * one flag at a time, until the prompt builder was a switch statement.
 *
 * So a kind brings its own shape and the shared discipline stays here. Everything a break owes
 * whatever it is — the grounding rules, the persona sheet and its diction reminder, the word ceiling,
 * the notes rule, the recent-scripts rule, the clock instruction — is in {@link systemPrompt} and
 * {@link userPrompt}, where no kind can opt out of it. What a shape may change is what the break IS:
 * one sentence, one opening, and any rule that is true of this kind and false of the one beside it.
 *
 * Shapes live beside their writers, so this file imports the interface and none of them.

    // played, which is why the interesting half of a break is the presenter's own reaction to it —
    // the thing a template can never write and the only reason a model is here at all. Stated as

    // quarters named neither record — "Tonight the groove lands. Friend, a cue from Jerez rises. The
    // pressing shows a twin mark" is a real one, and a listener has no idea what is playing.

 * ## It asks for ONE part, and that is the whole of what makes an arc an arc
 *
 * The instruction that matters most here is the one telling the model to stop: handed the shape of a
 * story a model will finish it, which is the measured failure this file records about every other
 * kind of material. A break that told parts two, three and four is not an arc, it is a story that
 * took one break and a listener who will never be asked back.
 *
 * ## Where it was left is the PREVIOUS part's own words
 *
 * Not what the break actually said about it, though the ledger holds that too. The previous beat is
 * prose an operator approved, it does not age out of `script_history`, and it says what the listener
 * was told rather than how — so a model reading it continues the story instead of being handed
 * somebody else's phrasing to echo.
 *
 * ## It still names the record
 *
 * `mustNameRecord` is unchanged, and this block does not excuse it. A break that told a beautiful
 * beat and never said what was playing is the failure `breaks.md` measured over thirty-nine
 * consecutive breaks, and an arc is not a reason to reopen it.

 * ## The failure
 *
 * Measured on air on 19 August, segment `e26a93f0`, labelled `Talk break: Madhouse into Run to the
 * Hills`: the script opened "That was Iron Maiden's "Run to the Hills," …" about the record that had
 * not played yet. Every existing check passed it — it is unmistakably the persona speaking, it is
 * inside the ceiling, and {@link namedRecordIn} is satisfied because it named a record it was shown.
 * Nothing asked WHICH side of the boundary that record was on.
 *
 * The prompt was never the problem: the two records are labelled "The record that has just finished"
 * and "The record coming up next" in as many words. This is the same shape as the persona
 * prohibitions — a rule the station was already sending and nothing was reading back — and the same
 * shape as the failure this whole file is built around, which the header states as framing real
 * facts as a CUE. The framing was banned there and is now checkable here.
 *
 * ## Why it refuses so narrowly
 *
 * Only where the name is attached to a frame: within {@link CUE_WINDOW_WORDS} after a forward one,
 * starting within {@link BACK_ANNOUNCE_LEAD_WORDS} of a back-announce, or straight before
 * {@link JUST_PLAYED}. Only where the name is UNAMBIGUOUS —
 * an identifier the two records share (two songs by one artist, a self-titled record) is dropped
 * from both, so "that was Megadeth" going into more Megadeth is not a fault. And never where the
 * RIGHT record is named in the same window too, since "that was Madhouse, and now Run to the Hills"
 * is a correct double cue and reads as one only if both are counted, and never where a frame of the
 * OTHER direction sits in the same window ("that's Lovefool coming up").
 *
 * ## One record is enough
 *
 * This used to ask nothing unless both records were known, on the argument that with one there is
 * no wrong side to confuse it with. That was wrong about the kinds it excused. A weather break, a
 * bulletin or a story is shown only the record coming up, so a back-announce of THAT record is wrong
 * by construction; it is the Lovefool break above. So a back-announce is judged whenever the next
 * record is known, and a forward cue whenever the previous one is.
 *
 * Every one of those is the same bargain the rest of the guards here are on: a refusal costs the
 * station the model's sentence and drops it to the floor, so this refuses only what it is sure of.

 *
 * The measurement behind refusing at all is in {@link contradictsDayPart}. The short version is that
 * the prompt asks and is obeyed most of the time, and the times it is not are all the same word.
 *
 * Three questions rather than one, because a daypart is a STRETCH and some words a break reaches for
 * name a point inside one — "midday" is the afternoon at ten past twelve and still the afternoon at
 * half past four, so no comparison of stretches will ever separate them. See
 * {@link namesWrongTimeOfDay}. The third is the sky, which names the time without naming a word for
 * it at all ("Night falls, my listeners" at a quarter to four). See {@link namesWrongSky}, which is
 * asked here and not of a production, for the reason given there. All three share this predicate,
 * and through it the `wrong-daypart` fault and its sentence, because they are the same thing to a
 * listener: the station saying what time it is and being wrong.
 *
 * ## It answers the WORD, and that is the whole of why it is not a boolean
 *
 * Both checks already know which word they caught, and this threw it away for as long as it returned
 * `true`. What that cost is a question nobody could answer from the record: `contradictsDayPart`
 * fires on one of four dayparts, and "which one, how often" is the difference between a sheet with
 * one habit and a model with a general problem. It answers the wording the SCRIPT used rather than
 * the table's, which is a second reason the word has to travel: since `DAYPART_CLAIMS`, "the
 * morning" and "good evening" are both things it can catch and neither is a phrase the table
 * carries. On the live station `conspiracy` sent a third of its breaks to the floor for
 * months with this fault among the leaders, and finding out which word did it meant reading raw
 * answers by hand, one at a time, only while `llm.captureWrites` happened to be on.
 *
 * The word reaches `script_history.reason` through {@link writeDecline}, so `scripts/break.declines.ts`
 * splits the fault by word with no change of its own: it groups on the reason string.

 * A script with the names of the records it was shown taken out of it.

 * ## A title is not a claim about the time
 *
 * Both clock checks read the script for words that say what time it is, and a record's name is full
 * of them: `Tonight, Tonight`, `(What's the Story) Morning Glory?`, `Midnight Rambler`, `In the
 * Evening`. A break that back-announces one of those has said nothing whatsoever about the moment,
 * and refusing it would cost the station the model's sentence for the crime of naming the record it
 * was given. This is not hypothetical for {@link namesWrongTimeOfDay}, which already matches
 * `midnight` as a bare word and so already refuses a midday break for back-announcing
 * `Midnight Train to Georgia`.
 *
 * So the names come out before either check reads the words. Taken from
 * {@link AnswerGuard.names} — the same records {@link namesNothing} asks about, through the same
 * {@link identifiersOf} — so what counts as naming a record is one answer and cannot drift into
 * being two.
 *
 * ## What it costs, and why that is the right direction
 *
 * A break that says the word as a title AND means it about the moment loses the second one too:
 * every `tonight` in a break that back-announced a record called `Tonight` looks identical. That is
 * a false NEGATIVE, and the file's whole bargain is that a break wrongly refused costs a sentence
 * the station wanted while a break wrongly passed costs one wrong word — with the floor underneath
 * being a correct sentence either way. The narrow miss is the survivable one.
 *
 * A guard carrying no records changes nothing, which keeps every kind that populates no names — a
 * welcome, a bulletin, a link at the top of an order — reading exactly the script it always did.
 *
 * ## The names come out and the punctuation stays
 *
 * Names are MATCHED as {@link bareWords}, because a curly apostrophe or a comma inside a title is not
 * a reason to miss it. They are CUT out of the lower-cased text itself, though, and not out of the
 * bare-words copy. The copy threw every stop away, and {@link namesWrongSky} needs the stops: it
 * looks for a sentence that OPENS on "Night falls", and with no stops left every word looks like
 * the middle of one sentence. `namesWrongTimeOfDay` needs them too, since it passes over a word
 * inside a comparison and a comparison ends at the next comma or stop. Both older checks read the
 * result exactly as they read the bare copy: `saysTime` lower-cases before its `includes`, `wholeWord`
 * bounds on letters, and the no-records path above always handed them the punctuated script anyway.

 * A century word with nothing that completes it. `twenty minutes`, `nineteen records` and a bare

 * there before it calls anything a year: a tens word (`nineteen sixty`), a ten-to-nineteen word
 * (`nineteen seventeen`), or an `oh` and a unit (`nineteen oh five`). `twenty two people` is
 * therefore not 2022, because a bare unit after a century completes nothing.
 *
 * A bare decade with no century — "back in seventy-two" — is a year to a listener and is not read as
 * one here. Catching it means reading every two-digit number word as a date, which refuses "forty
 * five seconds" and "the last twenty minutes" on a station whose breaks are full of both. That is
 * the same trade `withoutRecordNames` takes and in the same direction: a narrow miss is survivable

 * presenter can state from the booth with no note in front of them.
 *
 * ## `shown` is the prompt itself, and leaving it out made this a trick question
 *
 * **A persona's own material carries dates, and the station asks for them.** Measured over the 748
 * aired talk breaks this station has written: without this argument the check refuses 23 of them,
 * and 5 are the `conspiracy` host telling his own seeded story, which opens "Nineteen ninety-seven.
 * I was driving home". The prompt prints that story, the sheet asks him to bring it up, and the
 * break said it — so refusing it is the station asking for something and then declining a script for
 * doing it, which is the one thing every guard in this file is built not to do. See
 * {@link AnswerGuard.recent}, which is on the same bargain for the same reason.
 *
 * Passing the whole rendered prompt rather than enumerating the fields it came from is deliberate.
 * A sheet grows fields — `background`, the stories, the preoccupations, and whatever is added next —
 * and a list here would be right until the day somebody adds one, which is how a rule in this file
 * becomes a lie. What the model was SHOWN is the thing the bargain is actually about, and the prompt
 * is that, exactly, with nothing to keep in step.
 *
 * The one path it widens is {@link AnswerGuard.recent}: `recent` is filled from EVERY writer's
 * scripts, including a kind with no year guard at all, so a year one of them invented is quoted back
 * into the next prompt's "You said these recently" block and would be permitted here on the strength
 * of having been shown it. The station is asking about a year IT put there. Callers close this by
 * stripping `recent` back out of the messages before they reach `shown`; see {@link shownWithoutRecent}.
