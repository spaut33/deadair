 *
 * ONE, which is as small as this can be: the player needs the next item resolved before the current
 * one ends or the boundary is a gap, and nothing beyond that item has to be decided yet.
 *
 * It was three, and dropping it is what the bytes-before-air rule calls collapsing the commitment
 * horizon. It became affordable because a committed record's audio is now already on this machine, so
 * Liquidsoap's resolve is a loopback read of a local file rather than a provider download — the lead
 * used to be cover for a download that might take seconds, and there is no download left to cover.
 *
 * What it buys is everything an operator edit could have changed. An item handed to the player is
 * one they can no longer reorder or remove, so a lead of three put the next quarter of an hour out
 * of reach; at one, a skip, a reorder and a fresh running order all take effect on the next record
 * rather than three later.
 *
 * **What it costs is skip latency, and that is a real regression rather than a rounding error.**
 * `PLAYOUT_LEAD` is capped by this — the pusher can only hand over what has been prepared — and
 * Liquidsoap only resolves as many requests ahead as it has been given. Measured on this station and
 * recorded in `radio.liq`: a skip onto a resolved item lands in about 200ms, and one onto an
 * unresolved queue is over 1.2s late or produces no boundary at all. At a lead of one there is
 * exactly one resolved item, so the FIRST skip still lands and a second one taken before the
 * replacement resolves does not. That trade was made deliberately; if clicking through several
 * tracks matters more than edit latency, this and `PLAYOUT_LEAD` go back up together.
 */

 * {@link start} is the whole of it, and off air the change never comes: `PlayoutPusher`'s
 * `WARM_LEAD` is 0, so its reconcile never reaches `Rundown.next()` and the rundown never emits.
 *
 * On a warm station that is exactly right — the boundary is the change, and there is one every few
 * minutes. On a COLD one it deadlocks, because the pass that would ask for the bytes is the pass
 * that only runs once the bytes arrive. A fresh station sent its two `playout.cache_track` jobs and
 * then sat still: on 2026-08-20 the only thing that moved it for eight minutes was an operator
 * clicking Start over and over.
 *
 * A few seconds, and the yardstick is a DOWNLOAD rather than a boundary — the coarser cousin of
 * `RECONCILE_TICK_MS`, which has to be quick because it renews a lease with a six-second life. This
 * only has to notice that a record arrived, so anything much under a download's length is asking a
 * question whose answer cannot have changed.
 *
 * It is deliberately not a job. pg-boss cron is minute-granularity, which would put up to a minute
 * of dead air in front of the first listener; a self-rescheduling job would write a durable queue
 * row every few seconds forever to carry a decision that lives entirely in memory.

 * room for, which means the station is driven by what the player has actually
 * done rather than by a clock guessing at it.
 *
 * **It owns the running order outright.** One {@link StationLineup} per station, held here, edited
 * here, and written down from here. Nothing else writes it and there is no second copy for a request
 * to edit — which is the whole of stage 2 of `docs/internals/director.md` § "Who owns the running
 * order", and the reason the revision, the cursor and compaction are all gone rather than fixed.
 *
 * **Everything reaches it as a command on one queue**, handled one at a time and
 * in order: see {@link DirectorMailbox}. An operator's change, a finished refill
 * and the player's own events all arrive the same way, which is what stops two of
 * them landing in the middle of each other's decisions.
 *
 * The queue is not the whole answer, and the gap is worth knowing before adding
 * to it. Serializing decisions stops them interleaving; it does not un-decide one
 * already made. A pass that has gathered its material and is waiting on a database
 * read has already decided, and a command queued behind it arrives too late to
 * stop it. So anything that must CANCEL rather than merely follow — a stand-down,
 * a new running order — bumps {@link epoch} synchronously at the moment it happens
 * and posts only the durable half. `beginStandDown` and
 * `DirectorConsoleService.announceAirChange` are both written around that.
 *
 * One per process, for the reason `Rundown` and `PlayoutPusher` are: it holds
 * subscriptions and the running order, and a per-request copy would hand every
 * caller a different, empty view of what is on air. Its database work therefore
 * runs in a scope it opens per unit of work, the pattern `PlayoutModule.ready`
 * uses.
 *
 * **It only ever commits while `active`.** That flag is the station's own
 * switch, it is stored, and it is what makes a stand-down stick: an app that
 * merely stopped pushing would put the station back on air on its next tick, and
 * an app restarted after a stand-down would come back broadcasting something
 * nobody asked for.

     * anything out of it.
     *
     * **It notices for itself rather than being told.** The render job could post the moment a

     * `modules.ts`, so a job reaching for this class would invert the module edge. Reading the
     * segment's own state here needs nothing from the renderer, cannot be lost the way a message can,
     * and costs one indexed query per pass that answers nothing on the overwhelming majority of them.
     *

     * **It is also where a lost write is asked for again.** `BreakPlanner.ripen` re-offers every
     * `planned` break in its window on every boundary, which is what makes a dropped job free
     * everywhere else in the director — and it cannot cover this one, because it walks the running
     * order and a break waiting for its audio is deliberately not in it. So the re-offer lives here,
     * on the pass that is already reading these rows.
     *
     * **Expiry is the half that keeps this honest.** A break held back until its audio exists is a
     * break that can be held back forever, and airing one late is worse than not airing it: a
     * bulletin that took twenty minutes to write and speak is not news, and a welcome for a listener
     * who left ten minutes ago is a station talking to an empty room. So a request past its deadline
     * is retired here whether or not it ever became ready, and its segment is failed rather than
     * deleted — carrying the reason, and inert.

     * one is along shortly and silence is the worse outcome.
     *
     * **What goes in is ONE item where the beats were joined**, which is the ordinary case on a

     * is not ready is skipped, never waited for" rule needs no exception for productions, and nothing

     * back `ready` whether the join worked or not. Nothing about the join is required: a station
     * with no analyzer, or one whose analyzer cannot join, reaches `ready` with no joined row and the
     * beats go in as a block exactly as they always did.

     * host keeps it, which is `PersonaRepository.presenting`'s precedence and not a rule to reverse
     * from here.
     *
     * The second half is the breaks. A recast changes nothing about the RECORDS, so nothing is
     * committed and nothing is retracted; what it changes is who is about to speak, and the station
     * has usually already written and spoken a couple of breaks in the outgoing character. Those go

     * **Who was presenting before is never asked, and cannot be.** On the station's own path this
     * runs after the new persona is already active, so the question has no answer left; and it does
     * not need one, because being out of character is a property of the ROW — every break stamped

     * start, and clearing the script of something already handed over would take the words out from

     * window, because the set is small and a break written early is exactly the one this is for.
     *
     * Swallowed on failure, and that is the point of the `try`: the operator's change of host is

     * The audible half of the warm-up. A record is not committed until its bytes are here, so a
     * station given a fresh running order has a full hour planned and cannot play a second of it
     * until the first download lands — and a listener who tunes into that hears silence and has no
     * way to tell it from a station that is broken.
     *
     * Five conditions, each of which is the whole reason for a line of it.
     *
     * **Only while somebody is there.** A segment handed over off air plays out to NOBODY: with
     * `driving` false Liquidsoap's `remainingMs` still falls with the wall clock, which is the
     * measurement `WARM_LEAD = 0` exists for. Planting one on an idle station would spend the
     * holding message on an empty room and then have nothing left to say when a listener arrived.
     *
     * **Only while the wait is HEALTHY.** Bounded by {@link WAITING_ON_AUDIO_MS}, the same threshold
     * the feed reports on, so the holding message covers exactly the stretch that is normal and then
     * gets out of the way. A station whose provider has died should go quiet and let the fault be
     * audible, rather than reassuring a listener every thirty seconds all night that music is coming.
     *
     * **One at a time.** The order is walked for a `warmup` segment that has not been played yet, so
     * the next is planted only once the last has actually aired. That is what makes it a loop rather
     * than a pile, and it needs no memory of its own: the running order IS the memory.
     *
     * **Canned first.** A file in `media/segments/inbox/warmup/` is already `ready` — no model, no
     * speech plugin, no wait — so it airs on this pass. The written floor behind it is a whole
     * write-and-render cycle, which is worth having and is not worth waiting for when the operator
     * has recorded something.
     *
     * **Never fatal.** Swallowed exactly as {@link plantBreaks} is, and more so: this is the one
     * thing in the pass whose entire purpose is to make a failure more bearable, so it must not be
     * able to cause one.
