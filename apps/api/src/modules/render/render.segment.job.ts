 * `written → rendering → ready`, or `failed` with the reason. This is the piece
 * [dj-voice](https://github.com/robert-dean/deadair/discussions/13) calls the whole of the missing infrastructure, and the second half of
 * making a break: deciding what it says is `WriteBreakJob`'s, one stage earlier.
 *
 * It starts at `written` rather than at `planned` deliberately. A break whose words have not been
 * decided is not this job's to render, and a retry after a failed synthesis re-speaks the words
 * already on the row rather than sending the break back to be rewritten — which on a model would be
 * a bill as well as a change nobody asked for.
 *
 * A plain `Job` and not a `TransactionalJob`, following `ExtendLineupJob` and `EnrichmentJob`:
 * wrapping it would pin a runtime-pool connection for the length of a synthesis, which is seconds
 * of somebody else's compute, and the writes at either end are one row each.
 *
 * ## Why nothing waits on this
 *
 * The director SKIPS a segment that is not `ready` rather than holding a slot open for it. So a
 * render that is slow, or broken, or never runs at all, costs the station a break and never
 * silence — which is what makes it safe for this to be a background job with no deadline anyone
 * downstream cares about, and why the failure path here is a logged row rather than an alert.
 *
 * Safe to retry, and guarded against being retried while still running: `claimForRender` is a
 * conditional update, so a second attempt arriving mid-synthesis finds the row already `rendering`
 * and stops rather than paying twice for the same audio.
