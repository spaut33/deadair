     * Move each break's projected air time to where the order now says it lands.
     *
     * `airs_at` is a PROJECTION, and until this existed it was stamped once when the break was
     * planted and never revised — which the field's own note said out loud ("nothing recomputes the
     * schedule in between") as though it were a property rather than a bug. It is read by
     * `WriteBreakJob` to derive the clock, the greeting and the daypart, and by `patienceFor` to
     * decide how long the break may wait for a model slot. Both of those are questions about the
     * moment the words are SPOKEN, so both were being answered from a number that stopped being
     * true the first time the order drifted.
     *
     * ## The loop this closes
     *
     * A break planted forty minutes ahead is projected forty minutes ahead, and the projection is a
     * lower bound over items whose lengths are partly unknown. When the order runs late past it, the
     * phrasing the break was written with — "coming up to quarter to one" — falls out of the window
     * `claims_time_*` records, `brokenClaim` reports `late`, and `BreakPlanner.rewriteStale` reopens
     * it. The rewrite then derived the SAME phrasing from the SAME unrevised `airs_at` and stamped
     * the SAME already-closed window, so the next pass reopened it again, once per boundary, until
     * the slot arrived and the break was dropped for still being `planned`.
     *
     * That is precisely the loop `break.claims.ts` documents for an EARLY time claim and excludes
     * from rewriting. `late` was left in on the reading that "the slot has drifted past the phrasing
     * and a rewrite fixes it", which is true only if the rewrite is told where the slot actually is.
     * This is what tells it. Measured on the live station on 30 August: 234 reopens in seven days,
     * one break written twelve times, and 76 breaks passed over at their slot for being `planned`.
     *
     * With the projection current, a rewrite derives a phrasing for a moment that has not passed, so
     * the verdict becomes `early` at worst — which the planner already refuses to act on, and which
     * is therefore where the loop terminates rather than where it restarts.
     *
     * ## What it deliberately does not touch
     *
     * `writing` and `rendering` are left alone. Not for {@link reopen}'s reason — this moves no
     * state and takes nothing out from under a job — but because the job holding such a row has
     * ALREADY read `airs_at` and derived its phrasing from it, so re-stamping under it would leave
     * the row describing a projection its own words were not written from. They are caught on the
     * next pass, in whatever state they finish in.
     *
     * A row already at the value it would be given is skipped by the statement rather than by the
     * caller, so a settled order costs one query and no writes.
     *
     * Best-effort at the call site, like everything else that repairs rather than decides: a
     * projection that could not be written leaves the row exactly as stale as it already was.
     *
     * @param projections segment id to when the order now says that segment airs, as epoch millis.

     * ## Why there is a CTE, and why the guard is written twice
     *
     * `segment_events` wants the state the row LEFT, and `returning` on an update answers with the
     * state it arrived at — so for as long as this existed it recorded a flat `written` for every
     * row it moved, while the guard admits three. A break that was fully rendered and `ready` was
     * therefore logged as `written -> planned`, which is not a cosmetic slip: it hides that the
     * rewrite threw away a finished, spoken audio file, and the timeline reads as though nothing
     * was spent. Found on the live station on 30 August, where one break was reopened four times
     * with a `rendering -> ready` immediately before each one and every reopen claimed `written`.
     *
     * The `before` CTE captures `(id, state)` as they stand and the update joins to it, which
     * PostgreSQL has answered since long before `RETURNING OLD.*` arrived in 18 — deliberately, on
     * this being a self-hostable station rather than one pinned to a major version for the sake of
     * an audit column.
     *
     * **{@link reopening} applies the guard to BOTH, and that duplication is the point.** The CTE
     * sees the snapshot the statement opened with; the update re-checks its own `where` against the
     * row it locks. Filtering only in the CTE would let a row that became `writing` between the two
     * be reset underneath the job that had just claimed it — the one thing the guard exists to
     * prevent — and filtering only in the update would let the CTE hand back a state for a row the
     * update passed over. Neither is a state a test would notice, so they share one builder.
