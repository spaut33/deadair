 *
 * - `icecast.xml` — the full Icecast config, passwords and identity filled in
 * - `radio.env`   — a shell-sourced env file the Liquidsoap entrypoint loads
 *
 * Best-effort throughout: an unconfigured stream or an unwritable config dir
 * logs and skips rather than failing boot. Both containers fall back to their
 * committed static defaults in that case, so the mount still comes up.
 *
 * A render says what is ON DISK, not what was written, and that distinction is
 * load-bearing rather than tidy: both containers read their file once at
 * startup, so the only question anybody downstream asks is "is the process
 * older than the file it was configured from", and a render that rewrote
 * identical bytes on every boot would answer yes forever. See
